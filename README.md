# Wildcard Intersection

For purposes of this repository, let a *pattern* be a string that contains at most one wildcard
character given by $*$. A pattern describes a set of strings that can be matched by the contents of
the pattern. The wildcard is allowed to match zero or more characters.

This project demonstrates a method for computing the intersection of two patterns $x$ and $y$. The
result of the intersection is another pattern that matches the set of strings matched by both $x$
and $y$.
